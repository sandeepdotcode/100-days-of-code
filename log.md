**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some JavaScript code for the Library Project for The Odin Project
- Created function to add new book with form
- Created function to remove book from the Library(array as well as from cards displayed)

**Thoughts:** Today's work was pretty straigtforward except for some stupid mindless mistakes. Learned to process form input with JS.
