# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: February 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Wrote game winning logic(JavaScript) for the Tic Tac Toe game project for The Odin Project
- Completed fn. to play one move and check for end of game
- Created helper fn.s to return rows & columns from gameboard, check for win or draw, etc

**Thoughts:** Started being consistent for the last few days after slacking for months. This is my third time starting 100 days of code and this time I'm determined to stick with it. Third time's the charm!
