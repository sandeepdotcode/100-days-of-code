**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Wrote game winning logic(JavaScript) for the Tic Tac Toe game project for The Odin Project

- Created helper fn.s to return rows & columns from gameboard, check for win or draw, etc

**Thoughts:** Started being consistent for the last few days after slacking for months. This is my third time starting 100 days of code and this time I'm determined to stick with it. Third time's the charm!
